                    Once again, the tech geniuses of Silicon Valley have produced another winner for us to enjoy.
                    Apple has recently released their latest smartphones with the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max,
                    and we could not be more excited.<br><br> All in all, these new mobile devices use the same clean design and
                    attractive style as their predecessors, but with extra additions that make picking up your own iPhone 13
                    Pro or Pro Max a must. </p>

                    <p>The good news is that this year’s models have a little bit less difference between the two pro editions.They both feature brighter displays, enhanced cameras, and powerful A15 Bionic chipsets, but the size, battery,and pricing are pretty different.</p>

                    Unless you’ve been living off the grid for a while, you know that iPhones are mobile smartphone devices that
                    double as cell phones as well as computers, cameras, GPS, and more. Apple has been one of the best developers of
                    smartphones ever since their original iPhone model was released.Their annual meetings are more like rock shows we
                    all want to be invited to attend. <br><br>The latest model is the Apple iPhone 13 Pro, announced in September, and has 
                    many new features that make it a must-buy.</p>

                    <p> This new version really amps up the performance side of mobile computing with the A15 Bionic Chip. This new chipset 
                        features a six-core CPU and a 5-core GPU plus an upgraded Neural Engine. For those outside the tech world, this is like a brand 
                        new Ferrari engine in your pocket. You get the reliability of an Apple device with the power of a supercomputer. It is incredibly
                        fast and can handle way more app usage than previous models  </p>
