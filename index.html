Once again, the tech geniuses of Silicon Valley have produced another winner for us to enjoy. <br>
    Apple has recently released their latest smartphones with the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max, <br>
    and we could not be more excited. All in all, these new mobile devices use the same clean design and <br>
    attractive style as their predecessors, but with extra additions that make picking up your own iPhone 13 <br>
Pro or Pro Max a must.  </p>

<p>The good news is that this year’s models have a little bit less difference between the two pro editions. <br>
    They both feature brighter displays, enhanced cameras, and powerful A15 Bionic chipsets, but the size, battery, <br>
and pricing are pretty different.</p>

    Unless you’ve been living off the grid for a while, you know that iPhones are mobile smartphone devices that <br> 
    double as cell phones as well as computers, cameras, GPS, and more. Apple has been one of the best developers of <br>
    smartphones ever since their original iPhone model was released.Their annual meetings are more like rock shows we <br>
    all want to be invited to attend. The latest model is the Apple iPhone 13 Pro, announced in September, and has <br>
    many new features that make it a must-buy.</p>

<p> This new version really amps up the performance side of mobile computing with the A15 Bionic Chip. This new chipset <br>
    features a six-core CPU and a 5-core GPU plus an upgraded Neural Engine. For those outside the tech world, this is like a brand <br>
    new Ferrari engine in your pocket. You get the reliability of an Apple device with the power of a supercomputer. It is incredibly <br>
    fast and can handle way more app usage than previous models  </p>
